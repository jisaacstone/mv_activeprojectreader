Gatekeeper data, from the development reports.

Earliest report I could find in the wayback machine was from 2013.

Wrote a parser to extract data from the reports and put in sqlite.
Fetched data for all projects that had the word "gatekeeper".
Some files are missing or failed to parse, but I think I got most of the data.
